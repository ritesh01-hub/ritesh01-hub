## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science student who enjoys building things and understanding how they work under the hood.

- 💡 Currently focusing on **Data Structures & Algorithms** for strong problem-solving foundations  
- 🌱 Learning **Web Development** and improving project quality step by step  
- 🛠️ Believe in *learning by building*, refactoring, and revisiting concepts  
- 🎯 Long-term goal: become a **strong software engineer**, not just a framework user  

I value **consistency > speed**, and I prefer mastering fundamentals over chasing trends.
